`strict-stream` is a `TypeScript` library that provides tools to manage strictly typed streams. 

### Why?
It ensures that the data flowing through a stream conforms to a specific data type or structure, which helps catch errors early on, reduce bugs, and make code more reliable and easier to maintain.
